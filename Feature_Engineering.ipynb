        "- **Binning**: If you're converting a continuous variable like age into age groups, the number of bins or the bin edges are parameters.\n",
        "- **Scaling**: When using `StandardScaler` in Python, whether you center the data (mean = 0) or scale it to unit variance are parameters.\n",
